# Session Resume - VoiceTextRS Project

## Quick Context
Building an offline voice-to-notes transcription app in **Rust** (not Python!) on **Windows** (not WSL).

## Current Status (August 9, 2025)
✅ **Phase 1 COMPLETE** - Core audio recording is fully functional!
- Successfully tested 3-second recording with your Shokz OpenRun Pro headset
- Audio saves to `notes\2025\2025-08-09\*.wav` at 16kHz mono (perfect for Whisper)
- CLI working: `cargo run -- --test 3` or `cargo run -- --list-devices`

## Your Hardware
- **Microphone**: Headset (4- OpenRun Pro by Shokz) - 16kHz mono (DEFAULT) - PERFECT!
- **Alternative**: HDMI (Cam Link 4K) - 48kHz stereo

## Next Priority: Whisper Integration
You need to choose ONE:

### Option A: Install CMake (for native whisper-rs)
1. Download CMake from https://cmake.org/download/
2. Uncomment whisper-rs in Cargo.toml (line 16)
3. Uncomment features in Cargo.toml (lines 76-79)
4. Run `cargo build`

### Option B: Use Whisper Binary (easier, no CMake)
1. Download from: https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases
2. Extract to `whisper/` folder
3. We'll implement subprocess calling

## Key Files to Review
- `plan.md` - Full implementation plan with Rust details
- `background-research.md` - Technical notes, crate versions, known issues
- `src/core/audio.rs` - Working audio recording implementation
- `Cargo.toml` - Dependencies (whisper-rs currently commented out)

## Known Issues
1. **whisper-rs needs CMake** - Not installed yet
2. **Windows Defender** - May flag builds (you fixed this already)
3. **WebFetch tool** - Returns 404 for crates.io (use PowerShell instead)

## Commands That Work
```bash
# List audio devices
cargo run -- --list-devices

# Test recording (X seconds)
cargo run -- --test 5

# Build project
cargo build --release
```

## Architecture Decisions
- **Language**: Rust (performance, single binary)
- **UI**: Tauri 2.0 (future Android support)
- **Audio**: CPAL 0.16.0 (working!)
- **Transcription**: whisper-rs 0.14.4 OR binary fallback
- **Platform**: Windows-first, cross-platform architecture

## What's Next After Whisper?
1. Phase 2: Transcription Integration
2. Phase 3: System tray & global hotkeys
3. Phase 4: Tauri UI
4. Phase 5: Voice Activity Detection
5. Phase 6: Distribution/Installer

## Quick Questions to Answer
1. Did you install CMake? (for whisper-rs)
2. Or do you want to use whisper.exe binary?
3. Any issues with the audio recording?
