# Phase 3: System Integration - Implementation Notes

## Completed Features

### 1. System Tray Icon
- ✅ Custom microphone icon (blue when idle, red when recording)
- ✅ Context menu with options:
  - Start/Stop Recording
  - Settings submenu
  - Enable/Disable Hotkeys
  - Exit application
- ✅ Dynamic icon updates during recording

### 2. Global Hotkeys
- ✅ **Ctrl+Shift+R** - Toggle recording on/off
- ✅ **Ctrl+Shift+N** - Quick note (10 second recording)
- ✅ **Ctrl+Shift+V** - Show window (placeholder)
- ✅ Hotkeys can be enabled/disabled from tray menu

### 3. Desktop Notifications
- ✅ Recording started notification
- ✅ Recording stopped with duration
- ✅ Transcription complete with preview
- ✅ Error notifications

### 4. Background Service Mode
- ✅ Run with `cargo run -- --background`
- ✅ Runs in system tray
- ✅ Event loop for handling tray and hotkey events
- ✅ Async transcription processing

## Architecture

### Module Structure
```
src/
├── app.rs              # Main application controller
├── platform/
│   ├── tray.rs        # System tray implementation
│   ├── hotkeys.rs     # Global hotkey manager
│   └── notifications.rs # Desktop notifications
```

### Key Components

#### TrayManager (`platform/tray.rs`)
- Creates system tray icon with menu
- Handles menu events
- Updates icon based on recording state
- Communicates via TrayCommand enum

#### HotkeyManager (`platform/hotkeys.rs`)
- Registers global hotkeys
- Handles hotkey events
- Can be enabled/disabled
- Communicates via HotkeyEvent enum

#### App Controller (`app.rs`)
- Coordinates all components
- Manages recording state
- Handles async transcription
- Main event loop for background mode

## Usage

### Background Mode
```bash
# Start in background with system tray
cargo run -- --background

# Hotkeys available:
# Ctrl+Shift+R - Toggle recording
# Ctrl+Shift+N - Quick 10-sec note
# Ctrl+Shift+V - Show window
```

### CLI Mode (still works)
```bash
# Record and transcribe
cargo run -- --record 5

# Transcribe file
cargo run -- --transcribe audio.wav

# List devices
cargo run -- --list-devices
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Tray Menu Events**: Currently simplified - menu item IDs not fully tracked
2. **Quick Note**: Auto-stop after 10 seconds needs proper async handling
3. **Show Window**: Placeholder - needs Tauri UI implementation
4. **Settings**: No persistent settings yet

## Important Implementation Details

### Hotkey Library Choice
- **win-hotkeys 0.5.1** is used (NOT win-hotkey singular or windows-hotkeys)
- Runs event loop in separate thread
- Uses `register_hotkey()` method with VKey enums
- Handles Windows message pump internally

## Testing Notes

- System tray icon appears in Windows taskbar notification area
- Hotkeys work globally (even when app not focused)
- Notifications appear in Windows Action Center
- Recording and transcription work in both CLI and background modes

## Next Steps (Phase 4)

1. Implement Tauri UI for window display
2. Add settings persistence
3. Improve menu event handling with proper ID tracking
4. Add more configuration options
